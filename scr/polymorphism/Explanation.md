Polymorphism in Java:

    Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Java, polymorphism is mainly achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Polymorphism
        üîπ Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
        Occurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters.
        It is resolved at compile time.

Example:

class MathOperations {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
        üîπ Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

        Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
        It is resolved at runtime using dynamic method dispatch.

Example (as shown in PolymorphismExample.java):

Animal myAnimal = new Dog();
myAnimal.makeSound();  // Calls Dog's overridden method

2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Benefits of Polymorphism

        ‚úî Code Reusability ‚Äì Reduces code duplication by allowing multiple behaviors under a single interface.
        ‚úî Extensibility ‚Äì Makes it easier to extend and modify the code without breaking existing functionality.
        ‚úî Flexibility ‚Äì Allows writing general and reusable code for different types of objects.
