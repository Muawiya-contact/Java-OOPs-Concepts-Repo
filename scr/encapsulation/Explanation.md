This file explains the Encapsulation concept in Java.

ðŸ”¹ What is Encapsulation?

        Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP principles that involves:

        Hiding the internal details of a class.
        Using private variables with public getter & setter methods to control access.
        Improves security, reusability, and maintainability.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Encapsulation:

        Data Hiding â†’ Private variables cannot be accessed directly.
        Controlled Access â†’ Getters and setters provide controlled access.
        Reusability â†’ Makes the class easier to maintain and modify.

ðŸ”¹ Example Breakdown:

        private String name; â†’ Private data member.
        public String getName() â†’ Public getter method to access name.
        public void setAge(int age) â†’ Public setter method to modify age with a validation check.
        In the main() method, we create a Person object and modify its values safely.

        Age: 25
        Updated Name: Alice Smith
        Updated Age: 30
